In December of 2022 I started a new position as Scala developer at Adevinta. Scala is a cool language to work in - the combination of functional programming and a powerful OOP system makes it perfect for the kind of stuff I do.

Before that, I was Scala developer and Scrum Master at [Simacan](https://github.com/simacan).

------
The next section needs updating. :)

At Simacan, I worked on connecting traffic and map datar, to give customers the best possible real-time insight in their logistics operations. 

I worked on routing and real-time traveltime calculation algorithms, and built API connections with other parties using standards such as [Open Trip Model](https://www.opentripmodel.org/).

Some of the technologies and tools I worked with at Simacan:
- Scala, using technologies such as the Akka Framework.
- AWS.
- PostgreSQL.
- QGIS.
- Apache Kafka and Apache Avro.
- Open Trip Model.
- Java and Python, on occassion.
- And of course Scrum.
