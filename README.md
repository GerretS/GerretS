I am a Scala developer and Scrum Master at [Simacan](https://github.com/simacan). Scala is a cool language to work in - the combination of functional programming and a powerful OOP system makes it perfect for the kind of stuff I do.

At Simacan, I work on connecting traffic and map data and all sorts of logistical partners together, to give our customers the best possible real-time insight in their logistics operations. 

You can often find me working on routing and real-time traveltime calculation algorithms, as well as building API connections with other parties using standards such as [Open Trip Model](https://www.opentripmodel.org/).

Some of the technologies and tools I work with:
- Scala, using technologies such as the Akka Framework.
- AWS.
- PostgreSQL.
- QGIS.
- Apache Kafka and Apache Avro.
- Open Trip Model.
- Java and Python, on occassion.
- And of course Scrum.
